=== WMO Activities

==== Coordination, alignment and support (TODO Dave/Enrico)

* Coordination/support functions
* Software selection for WMO projects and application development
* Managing FOSS activities
* Aligning with WMO ecosystem of activities
* Ensuring sustainability of FOSS usage
* Managing risk
* Functions
* People

==== Standards compliance

* Compatability / compliance matrix
* Open Standards <-> FOSS support matrix
* Implementation of WMO Tech Regs / compliance ?

FOSS can also play a significant role as an indicator of the feasibility of Technical Regulation
implementation.  As part of the standards development phase, developing the associated FOSS
implementation(s) aids in determining "fit for purpose" of the specification.  In addition, FOSS
implementation during standards development allows for an open review and assessment on how a
standard is implemented (supported network protocols, avaiability of tooling/libraries for
integration, as well as speed of implementation (if a FOSS implementation during the development
of a standard takes a considerable level of effort, why?  Is the complexity acceptable for the
scope of the standard?  Determining these aspects earlier can help improve and adjust the standard
while in development (as opposed to formal amendment processes once approved by WMO).  The agile and parallel
development of WIS2 standards and FOSS is a key example in this context (see <<_case_study_wis2_foss_and_agile_development>>).

Another indicator is the number of implementations.  For example, the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC)
mandates that a proposed standard requires at least 3 implementations for consideration by its
Technical Committee.  This provides "proof" to the Technical Committee that the standard can be
implemented, and has investment from various projects as early adopters.

In summary, while FOSS is not in scope for being identified as part of a Technical Regulation, it
is a strong indicator of the the maturity, applicability and sustainability of a given standard.  Implementing
FOSS during standards development provides safety in investment, iterative improvements,
and confidence for widespread and sustainable adoption and implementation by Members.

==== Software review and evaluation

* Software identification and selection (TODO Vasile)
** Project checklist/assessment
* "Approved projects" and/or Reference Implementations
** Make Tech Regs more concrete
** Tech Regs -> FOSS implementations
** Should FOSS be cited in WMO Tech Regs (suggest no)
** Criteria needed (TODO Jian)
*** Compliance (data exchange)
*** Software evaluation (FOSS!) checklist -> confidence
*** Readiness
*** Bus/retirement factor
** Rolling review
* Harmonization: regular review of ecosystem to ensure alignment and optimal use of resources

===== Compliance (data exchange)

* **Standards alignment**: The software adheres to WMO technical standards and common industry specifications, unifying
data exchange interfaces and formats.
* **Data protection**: It complies with international conventions and national data protection regulations by
implementing data desensitization, encrypted data transmission, and secure storage of sensitive meteorological data.
* **Cross-border data security**: It meets data cross-border transfer requirements in operational regions by establishing
a full lifecycle data-security management mechanism. This mechanism covers data collection, processing, sharing, and
archiving in line with WMO data policies.

===== Software evaluation

* **Core Evaluation Checklist**:
** __Technical Quality__: Functionality completeness and accuracy for meteorological use cases, performance when
processing massive meteorological datasets (e.g., real-time observational data, forecast model outputs), reliability
under peak load conditions, security, maintainability, and compatibility with existing meteorological systems.
** __Compliance__: License is OSI-approved with no license conflicts, and complies with WMO data policies and relevant regulations.
** __Community Sustainability__: Recent community activity (within the last 6–12 months), stability of the maintenance
team, regularity of version releases, and maturity of the ecosystem.
** __Cost-effectiveness__: Controllable costs across the software lifecycle (deployment, operation, maintenance, training,
migration, and decommissioning).
** __Business Fit__: Aligns with existing meteorological operational processes, good usability for forecasters and data
analysts, and support for future expansion needs.

* **Confidence Assurance:**

** Adopt standardized evaluation processes and quantifiable metrics to ensure objectivity and repeatability of results.
** Validate core functionality through a Proof-of-Concept (PoC) approach, incorporating feedback collected from real-world operational scenarios.
** Conduct multi-dimensional verification, including code audits, security vulnerability scans, and in-depth open source community research, to confirm the reliability of the software.

===== Readiness

Completed drafting of requirements specification documents, and form a professional evaluation team (including technical, business, legal, and operations personnel).

Set up a simulated meteorological operations testing environment, and prepare test data (including extreme weather scenario data) and necessary evaluation tools.

Define clear priorities for software requirements and establish final decision criteria, such as approval for full adoption, conditional adoption, or rejection. Document the rationale for all decisions for audit purposes.

===== Bus/retirement factor

===== Business Fit and Retirement Considerations

* Business Fit

** Offers seamless integration with existing meteorological operational processes, minimizing the need for process adjustments.
** Supports custom development and feature expansion to meet evolving needs (such as business scaling and new scenario integration).
** Aligns with users’ habits in meteorological operations by providing a user-friendly interface and flexible configuration options.

* Retirement Planning

** Establish a clear data archiving plan to ensure secure storage and traceability of historical meteorological data after the software is decommissioned.
** Proactively assess the costs of migrating to new systems, and establish a smooth migration path to ensure business continuity.
** Define clear responsibilities and standardized procedures for software retirement to mitigate potential risks (e.g., data leakage, system conflicts, and service disruptions).

==== Case study: WIS2, FOSS, and agile development

The WMO Information System 2.0 (WIS 2.0) is the framework for WMO data sharing in the 21st century for all WMO domains and disciplines. It supports the WMO Unified Data policy and the Global Basic Observing Network (GBON) and makes international, regional, and national data sharing simple, effective, and inexpensive. The idea that no Member should be left behind and the objective of lowering the barrier to adoption has been at the core of WIS 2.0 development. These objectives inspire the principles underpinning the WIS 2.0 technical framework, such as adopting open standards and Web technologies to facilitate sharing of increasing variety and volume of real-time data.footnote:[https://wmo.int/wis-20]

The WMO Executive Council, through https://library.wmo.int/idviewer/66258/1147[Resolution 34 (EC-76)] - Implementation plan update of the WMO Information System 2.0, endorsed the WMO Information System 2.0 (WIS2) implementation plan. The Resolution also recognized the importance of establishing a pilot phase to develop the WIS2 infrastructure and begin testing it, in order to be ready for a pre-operational phase in 2024, and then for the transition starting in 2025.

The pilot phase was completed at the end of 2023, with several Members collaborating in building the WIS2 infrastructure. Each Member had a different role in the WIS2 framework and implemented a specific component. Starting in January 2024, the implementation of WIS2 entered the pre-operational phase in preparation for transitioning to WIS2.  On 01 January 2025, WIS2 became operational.footnote:[https://wmo-im.github.io/wis2-transition-guide/transition-guide/wis2-transition-guide-APPROVED.html#_1_introduction]

WIS2 is comprised of a number of key standards, including (but are not limited to):

* Internet and messaging protocols for data and metadata transmission (HTTP, MQTT)
* metadata encodings for dataset descriptions (WMO Core Metadata Profile) and notifications (WIS2 Notification Message)
* topic structures for real-time notifications (WIS2 Topic Hierarchy)
* interfaces and APIs for Global Services (Global Discovery Catalogue)

Throughout the WIS2 Implementation timeline, the https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wmo-im/wis2-guide/refs/heads/main/guide/images/architecture/c4.container.png[architecture], standards definitions as well as key software components were developed, deployed and tested in parallel, in an agile manner.  These software include (but are not limited to):

Driven by collaboration, the development and testing of FOSS significantly helped with early assessment of the WIS2 standards in development.  As a result, WIS2 standards were being tested in an agile environment and rapid feedback was provided that helped refine, adjust and improve the standards early and often.

WIS2 FOSS implementations have resulted in a more stable and robust program delivery with significantly reduced risk to Members.  In addition, some tools have emerged as "Reference Implementations" as key resources for the precise implementation of various WIS2 standards which can either be deployed or studied by Members accordingly.  WIS2 Technical Regulations were approved with confidence as a result of the agile development of Open Standards and Open Source.
