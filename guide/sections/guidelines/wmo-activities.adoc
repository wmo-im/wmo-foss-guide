=== WMO Activities

==== Coordination, alignment and support

* coordination/support functions
* software selection for WMO application development
* managing FOSS activities
* Aligning with WMO ecosystem of activities
* ensuring sustainability of FOSS usage
* managing risk
* functions
* people

==== Standards compliance

* compatability / compliance matrix
* Open Standards <-> FOSS support matrix
* implementation of WMO Tech Regs / compliance ?
* FOSS as an early indicator of Tech Regs feasibility
** ensure FOSS implementations are part of Technical Regulation development/assessment (feasibility)
** example: wis2box, developed at the same time as WIS2 standards
** example: OGC standards (3 implementations)
** FOSS is not part of the Tech Reg, but is an indicator of maturity/capability

==== Software review and evaluation

* software identification and selection
** project checklist/assessment
* "approved projects" and/or Reference Implementations
** make Tech Regs more concrete
** Tech Regs -> FOSS implementations
** should FOSS be cited in WMO Tech Regs (suggest no)
** criteria needed
*** compliance (data exchange)
*** software evaluation (FOSS!) checklist -> confidence
*** readiness
*** bus factor
** rolling review
* harmonization: regular review of ecosystem to ensure alignment and optimal use of resources

==== Application development

* case study: wis2box et. al.
** agile development during Tech Reg development
