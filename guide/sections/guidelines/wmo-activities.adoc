=== WMO Activities

==== Coordination, alignment and support

* Coordination/support functions
* Software selection for WMO projects and application development
* Managing FOSS activities
* Aligning with WMO ecosystem of activities
* Ensuring sustainability of FOSS usage
* Managing risk
* Functions
* People

==== Standards compliance

* Compatability / compliance matrix
* Open Standards <-> FOSS support matrix
* Implementation of WMO Tech Regs / compliance ?
* FOSS as an early indicator of Tech Regs feasibility
** Ensure FOSS implementations are part of Technical Regulation development/assessment (feasibility)
** Example: wis2box, developed at the same time as WIS2 standards
** Example: OGC standards (3 implementations)
** FOSS is not part of the Tech Reg, but is an indicator of maturity/capability

==== Software review and evaluation

* Software identification and selection
** Project checklist/assessment
* "Approved projects" and/or Reference Implementations
** Make Tech Regs more concrete
** Tech Regs -> FOSS implementations
** Should FOSS be cited in WMO Tech Regs (suggest no)
** Criteria needed
*** Compliance (data exchange)
*** Software evaluation (FOSS!) checklist -> confidence
*** Readiness
*** Bus/retirement factor
** Rolling review
* Harmonization: regular review of ecosystem to ensure alignment and optimal use of resources

==== Application development

* Case study: wis2box et. al.
** Agile development during Tech Reg development
