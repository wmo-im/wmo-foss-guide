==== Using FOSS

===== Risks

* **License compliance risks** Open source licenses often have widely varying requirements regarding commercial use, redistribution, and code modification. Certain licenses include restrictive clauses, such as mandating that derivative works be made open source or that original copyright notices be preserved in full. Violations may lead to legal disputes and intellectual property issues.
* **Security and continuity risks**: Open source software from niche projects or less-established projects may pose security risks due to limited formal code audits. Additionally, the complexity of open source software supply chains creates vulnerabilities that could be exploited to implant malicious code. These risks are amplified in meteorological applications, especially  when handling sensitive observational data or real-time forecasting models.
* **Maintenance risks**: Fixes for vulnerabilities rely on community responsiveness. If an open source project is discontinued,  known vulnerabilities may remain unaddressed.
* **Support risks**: Most open source software lacks official support. As a result, timely response and effective resolutions of critical operational system failures cannot be guaranteed, potentially leading to interruptions in meteorological operation and data loss.

===== Hidden costs

* **Technical adaptation and integration costs**: Human resources must be allocated for secondary development (customization), system interface integration, and compatibility testing to ensure the software aligns with existing business systems.
* **Long-term maintenance and version management costs**: Dedicated personnel are needed to track version updates, conduct testing, and manage migrations. If a project is discontinued, taking over its maintenance internally entails high technical challenges and added operational complexity.
* **Talent acquisition and training costs**: Recruiting skilled professionals can be expensive, and ongoing in-house training is required to maintain the necessary expertise.
* **Compliance audit and management costs**: It is necessary to maintain an inventory of all open source components and perform regular compliance audits. Large meteorological organizations may also need to develop dedicated management platforms, with costs increasing as the number of components grows.


==== Contributing to FOSS

===== National policies

The adoption and development of FOSS within NMHSs can be significantly strengthened through supportive national-level policies. Several WMO Members have already introduced digital government strategies that encourage the use of open standards, open data and open-source software as default options within public administrations. Where such frameworks exist, NMHSs can leverage them to increase efficiency, reduce vendor lock-in and ensure long-term sustainability of operational systems. 

National FOSS-related policies may include: 

* "Open by default" procurement rules requiring public institutions to consider FOSS alternatives alongside proprietary solutions when acquiring software. In some countries, like Romania, when you purchase "on demand" software development services, the source code should be transferred to the customer along with all the IPR associated with the software. Making the source code available under an open-source license is highly recommended. 
* Guidelines for software development funded from public budget, encouraging publication of code under approved open-source licenses. 
* Policies promoting interoperability and open standards, which naturally align with FOSS implementations within WIS2 and other WMO technical frameworks. 
* Capacity-building programs that enable staff to acquire skills for maintaining and developing open-source tools, reducing long-term operational dependency on external vendors. 
* Security and lifecycle requirements to ensure that open-source components used in critical systems follow maintenance, patching, auditing and version management rules. 

Where no national regulations exist, NMHSs can still develop institution-level policies or internal guidelines to support responsible FOSS adoption: 

* Establish internal rules for licensing, contribution approval and repository management. 
* Define procedures for evaluating FOSS components (governance, community health, maintenance model). 
* Incorporate sustainability planning (including contribution back to upstream projects when fixes or new features are developed internally). 
* Promote transparency by adopting open repositories for research software and operational tools. 

* Events/hackathons (e.g. OGC/OSGeo/ASF Joint Sprints) TODO Vasile 
** By product: connection/collab 

* Regulations / risk / constraints / considerations 
** Features, maintenance, project  

==== Managing FOSS activities

In some cases, Members developing their own FOSS in support of WMO obligations and activities may wish to make the software freely available to the public.  The current FOSS landscape and infrastructure provides a strong support mechanism for doing FOSS development in the open, using services such as https://github.com[GitHub], https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org[GitLab], https://codeberg.org[Codeberg] and numerous other platforms.

In the same spirit as contributing to FOSS, where no national regulations exist, NMHSs can still develop institution-level policies or guidelines in support of making FOSS available to the public.  The following are (some) key aspects to consider:

* Establish an "architecture of participation":
** Who will be responsible for development, release management, and accepting external contributions?
** How will commit access be governed and managed?  Does the project need a project steering committee or group of stakeholders to help drive the project?
** How will external collaboration be addressed?  For example, will the project have a bug or issue tracker which can be used to identify new feature development, defects and/or bugs.  Will there be a dedicated discussion forum or mailing list for wider discussion?
** Make clear how collaboration will work to the public (for example, by providing a ``CONTRIBUTING.md`` document for GitHub)
** Make clear how security issues should be addressed (mitigation/release policies/timelines, contact points, etc.)
** What is the release schedule for new versions?
* Choose a license that the software will be made available with (such as the Apache License, Version 2.0, MIT, etc.).  It is strongly advised to consider and consult organization policies to ensure proper licensing and understanding risk, responsibility and liability
* Choose the mechanism by which the software will be made available (GitHub, GtiLab, Codeberg, organizational website, etc.)
* Ensure that a ``README`` is available with the code stating a clear mission and purpose
* Identify any supported WMO Technical Regulations
* Ensure that the project has proper documentation for users (downloading, installing, configuring, running), as well as additinal documentation for developer or othe audience types (administrators, etc.)
* Ensure the code is versioned (for example using Git as a version control system)

==== Core Benefits of Open Source Software

The core benefits of open source software can be summarized on three dimensions: autonomy and control, cost optimization,
and ecosystem flexibility—offering both practical advantages and adaptability. Details are as follows:

* **Exceptional autonomy and control**: The code is open and licenses are flexible, allowing meteorological organizations to perform deep customization as needed, directly modifying the code to add or remove functional modules to suit unique operational scenarios (e.g., regional weather forecasting adjustments). This level of access also allows them to independently identify and fix vulnerabilities, optimize performance for massive meteorological data processing, and control the technical roadmap of core systems. Certain permissive licenses (e.g., MIT License, Apache License 2.0) even permit using modified code as closed source in commercial products, balancing customization needs with operational requirements.
* **Significant cost advantages**: No software license fees or subscription fees are required, suitable for national meteorological services as well as deployments in regional forecasting centers. The availability of source code and community documentation reduces trial-and-error costs during secondary development, making necessary human resource investment more manageable.  Meteorological organizations can also choose free community support or affordable third-party services (specialized in meteorological applications) instead of expensive vendor support packages.
* **Avoiding vendor lock-in risks**: Free from proprietary interfaces and data format dependencies, enabling free choice of deployment environments (e.g., private or public clouds). Even if the original project is discontinued, maintenance can be taken over independently or by a third party. Moreover, multiple service providers are often support the same open source software, strengthening the user’s bargaining power.
* **Excellent cross-platform portability**: Most open source tools run on multiple operating systems (e.g., Windows and Linux), eliminating the need for separate purchases. Adherence to common technical standards (e.g., WMO GRIB data formats) lowers system integration difficulty. Modular design facilitates containerized deployment and cross-cluster migration, adapting to architectural upgrades in meteorological data centers.

==== Profiling competencies

Members wishing to use, participate and/or manage FOSS activities should be familiar with basic FOSS principles, and assess their level of participation accordingly.  Understanding the architecture of participation of FOSS varies among projects.  In addition to domain and software development competencies, staff require the ability to analyze a given FOSS project and/or community, understanding how development, contributions and social and political infrastructure operate.  Staff should also be supported to participate in FOSS as part of their ongoing learning and development.  The degree to which these skills are developed depend on the level of FOSS investment by a given Member organization.
