=== WMO Members

==== Using FOSS

* FOSS as an option during software evaluation
* Risk, hidden costs (TODO Jian)
* Principles apply to ANY software
* Risk management
* Due diligence (maintenance, updates)
* Lifecycle management/EOL -> migration
* Total cost of ownership considerations
** HR profile / IT capacity of organization
* Benefits (freedom, cost, reducing vendor lock in, portability) (TODO Jian)
* Infrastructure considerations

==== Contributing to FOSS

===== National policies

The adoption and development of FOSS within NMHSs can be significantly strengthened through supportive national-level policies. Several WMO Members have already introduced digital government strategies that encourage the use of open standards, open data and open-source software as default options within public administrations. Where such frameworks exist, NMHSs can leverage them to increase efficiency, reduce vendor lock-in and ensure long-term sustainability of operational systems. 

National FOSS-related policies may include: 

* "Open by default" procurement rules requiring public institutions to consider FOSS alternatives alongside proprietary solutions when acquiring software. In some countries, like Romania, when you purchase "on demand" software development services, the source code should be transferred to the customer along with all the IPR associated with the software. Making the source code available under an open-source license is highly recommended. 
* Guidelines for software development funded from public budget, encouraging publication of code under approved open-source licenses. 
* Policies promoting interoperability and open standards, which naturally align with FOSS implementations within WIS2 and other WMO technical frameworks. 
* Capacity-building programs that enable staff to acquire skills for maintaining and developing open-source tools, reducing long-term operational dependency on external vendors. 
* Security and lifecycle requirements to ensure that open-source components used in critical systems follow maintenance, patching, auditing and version management rules. 

Where no national regulations exist, NMHSs can still develop institution-level policies or internal guidelines to support responsible FOSS adoption: 

* Establish internal rules for licensing, contribution approval and repository management. 
* Define procedures for evaluating FOSS components (governance, community health, maintenance model). 
* Incorporate sustainability planning (including contribution back to upstream projects when fixes or new features are developed internally). 
* Promote transparency by adopting open repositories for research software and operational tools. 

* Events/hackathons (e.g. OGC/OSGeo/ASF Joint Sprints) TODO Vasile 
** By product: connection/collab 

* Regulations / risk / constraints / considerations 
** Features, maintenance, project  

==== Managing FOSS activities

In some cases, Members developing their own FOSS in support of WMO obligations and activities may wish to make the software freely available to the public.  The current FOSS landscape and infrastructure provides a strong support mechanism for doing FOSS development in the open, using services such as https://github.com[GitHub], https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org[GitLab], https://codeberg.org[Codeberg] and numerous other platforms.

In the same spirit as contributing to FOSS, where no national regulations exist, NMHSs can still develop institution-level policies or guidelines in support of making FOSS available to the public.  The following are (some) key aspects to consider:

* Establish an "architecture of participation":
** Who will be responsible for development, release management, and accepting external contributions?
** How will commit access be governed and managed?  Does the project need a project steering committee or group of stakeholders to help drive the project?
** How will external collaboration be addressed?  For example, will the project have a bug or issue tracker which can be used to identify new feature development, defects and/or bugs.  Will there be a dedicated discussion forum or mailing list for wider discussion?
** Make clear how collaboration will work to the public (for example, by providing a ``CONTRIBUTING.md`` document for GitHub)
** Make clear how security issues should be addressed (mitigation/release policies/timelines, contact points, etc.)
** What is the release schedule for new versions?
* Choose a license that the software will be made available with (such as the Apache License, Version 2.0, MIT, etc.).  It is strongly advised to consider and consult organization policies to ensure proper licensing and understanding risk, responsibility and liability
* Choose the mechanism by which the software will be made available (GitHub, GtiLab, Codeberg, organizational website, etc.)
* Ensure that a ``README`` is available with the code stating a clear mission and purpose
* Identify any supported WMO Technical Regulations
* Ensure that the project has proper documentation for users (downloading, installing, configuring, running), as well as additinal documentation for developer or othe audience types (administrators, etc.)
* Ensure the code is versioned (for example using Git as a version control system)
