==== Using FOSS

* FOSS as an option during software evaluation
* Risk, hidden costs (TODO Jian)
* Principles apply to ANY software
* Risk management
* Due diligence (maintenance, updates)
* Lifecycle management/EOL -> migration
* Total cost of ownership considerations
** HR profile / IT capacity of organization
* Benefits (freedom, cost, reducing vendor lock in, portability) (TODO Jian)
* Infrastructure considerations

==== Contributing to FOSS

===== National policies

The adoption and development of FOSS within NMHSs can be significantly strengthened through supportive national-level policies. Several WMO Members have already introduced digital government strategies that encourage the use of open standards, open data and open-source software as default options within public administrations. Where such frameworks exist, NMHSs can leverage them to increase efficiency, reduce vendor lock-in and ensure long-term sustainability of operational systems. 

National FOSS-related policies may include: 

* "Open by default" procurement rules requiring public institutions to consider FOSS alternatives alongside proprietary solutions when acquiring software. In some countries, like Romania, when you purchase "on demand" software development services, the source code should be transferred to the customer along with all the IPR associated with the software. Making the source code available under an open-source license is highly recommended. 
* Guidelines for software development funded from public budget, encouraging publication of code under approved open-source licenses. 
* Policies promoting interoperability and open standards, which naturally align with FOSS implementations within WIS2 and other WMO technical frameworks. 
* Capacity-building programs that enable staff to acquire skills for maintaining and developing open-source tools, reducing long-term operational dependency on external vendors. 
* Security and lifecycle requirements to ensure that open-source components used in critical systems follow maintenance, patching, auditing and version management rules. 

Where no national regulations exist, NMHSs can still develop institution-level policies or internal guidelines to support responsible FOSS adoption: 

* Establish internal rules for licensing, contribution approval and repository management. 
* Define procedures for evaluating FOSS components (governance, community health, maintenance model). 
* Incorporate sustainability planning (including contribution back to upstream projects when fixes or new features are developed internally). 
* Promote transparency by adopting open repositories for research software and operational tools. 

* Events/hackathons (e.g. OGC/OSGeo/ASF Joint Sprints) TODO Vasile 
** By product: connection/collab 

* Regulations / risk / constraints / considerations 
** Features, maintenance, project  

==== Managing FOSS activities (TODO Tom)

* Aligning with WMO standards
** Achieving compliance
