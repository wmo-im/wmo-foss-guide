<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Open source software has become increasingly crucial for WMO and its Members.  No longer a "niche" industry, FOSS now powers major initiatives and services worldwide, and is backed by industry support.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>FOSS solutions play a pivotal role as accelerators for the implementation of Early Warnings for All, a key WMO initiative aimed at protecting every person on Earth with life-saving early warning systems by 2027. By providing accessible, customizable, and cost-effective tools, FOSS enables Members to rapidly deploy and adapt early warning systems to their specific needs and contexts. This approach is particularly crucial for developing countries (LDCs) and small island developing states (SIDS), where resource constraints often hinder the implementation of proprietary solutions.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Moreover, FOSS initiatives serve as powerful catalysts in supporting Members' efforts towards digital transformation. As National Meteorological and Hydrological Services (NMHSs) worldwide strive to modernize their operations and services, FOSS now offer a flexible and scalable foundation for innovation. They enable Members to leverage cutting-edge technologies, collaborate on development, and share best practices, thus accelerating their digital transformation journeys while optimizing resource utilization.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>FOSS development and use among WMO Members has been a longstanding activity.  Typical FOSS implementations included decoders and encoder libraries of WMO BUFR and GRIB formats (e.g. ecCodes, degrib, libecbufr, etc.), as well as data dissemination services (THREDDS, GDAL, ERDDAP, etc.).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In addition, as part of the global open data/open science movement, numerous government organizations have put forth using FOSS by default; this includes use of exiting FOSS tools as well as developing of same, working in the open by default.  Free software development platforms and tools (for example, GitHub) have greatly lowered the barrier for sharing software for research, development and operations for all.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As part of the development of the WMO Information System (WIS2), FOSS implementation has been a significant activity, as exemplified by a number of Reference Implementations of WIS2 Standards (such as wis2box, wis2-gdc, etc.).  The development of software in the open during the pre-operational phases of WIS2 proved valuable in testing WIS2 Standards put forth in Technical Regulations while in development, promoting the “release early, release often” philosophy of agile and iterative development.
While FOSS is resident in numerous WMO Member organizations, guidance and coordination becomes more vital to ensure Member services are provided with security, privacy and safety in mind for WMO Members and beyond.</p>

<h5 id="_risks"><a class="anchor" href="#_risks"></a>Risks</h5>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p><strong>License compliance risks</strong> Open source licenses often have widely varying requirements regarding commercial use,
redistribution, and code modification. Certain licenses include restrictive clauses, such as mandating that derivative
works be made open source or that original copyright notices be preserved in full. Violations may lead to legal disputes
and intellectual property issues.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Security and continuity risks</strong>: Open source software from niche projects or less-established projects may pose
security risks due to limited formal code audits. Additionally, the complexity of open source software supply chains
creates vulnerabilities that could be exploited to implant malicious code. These risks are amplified in meteorological
applications, especially  when handling sensitive observational data or real-time forecasting models.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Maintenance risks</strong>: Fixes for vulnerabilities rely on community responsiveness. If an open source project is
discontinued,  known vulnerabilities may remain unaddressed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Support risks</strong>: Most open source software lacks official support. As a result, timely response and effective
resolutions of critical operational system failures cannot be guaranteed, potentially leading to interruptions
in meteorological operation and data loss.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="_hidden_costs"><a class="anchor" href="#_hidden_costs"></a>Hidden costs</h5>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p><strong>Technical adaptation and integration costs</strong>: Human resources must be allocated for secondary development (customization),
system interface integration, and compatibility testing to ensure the software aligns with existing business systems.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Long-term maintenance and version management costs</strong>: Dedicated personnel are needed to track version updates, conduct
testing, and manage migrations. If a project is discontinued, taking over its maintenance internally entails high
technical challenges and added operational complexity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Talent acquisition and training costs</strong>: Recruiting skilled professionals can be expensive, and ongoing in-house
training is required to maintain the necessary expertise.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Compliance audit and management costs</strong>: It is necessary to maintain an inventory of all open source components and
perform regular compliance audits. Large meteorological organizations may also need to develop dedicated management
platforms, with costs increasing as the number of components grows.</p>

<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="_national_policies"><a class="anchor" href="#_national_policies"></a>National policies</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The adoption and development of FOSS within NMHSs can be significantly strengthened through supportive national-level policies. Several WMO Members have already introduced digital government strategies that encourage the use of open standards, open data and open-source software as default options within public administrations. Where such frameworks exist, NMHSs can leverage them to increase efficiency, reduce vendor lock-in and ensure long-term sustainability of operational systems.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>National FOSS-related policies may include:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>"Open by default" procurement rules requiring public institutions to consider FOSS alternatives alongside proprietary solutions when acquiring software. In some countries, like Romania, when you purchase "on demand" software development services, the source code should be transferred to the customer along with all the IPR associated with the software. Making the source code available under an open-source license is highly recommended.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Guidelines for software development funded from public budget, encouraging publication of code under approved open-source licenses.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Policies promoting interoperability and open standards, which naturally align with FOSS implementations within WIS2 and other WMO technical frameworks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Capacity-building programs that enable staff to acquire skills for maintaining and developing open-source tools, reducing long-term operational dependency on external vendors.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Security and lifecycle requirements to ensure that open-source components used in critical systems follow maintenance, patching, auditing and version management rules.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Where no national regulations exist, NMHSs can still develop institution-level policies or internal guidelines to support responsible FOSS adoption:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Establish internal rules for licensing, contribution approval and repository management.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Define procedures for evaluating FOSS components (governance, community health, maintenance model).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Incorporate sustainability planning (including contribution back to upstream projects when fixes or new features are developed internally).</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>In some cases, Members developing their own FOSS in support of WMO obligations and activities may wish to make the software freely available to the public.  The current FOSS landscape and infrastructure provides a strong support mechanism for doing FOSS development in the open, using services such as <a href="https://github.com">GitHub</a>, <a href="https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org">GitLab</a>, <a href="https://codeberg.org">Codeberg</a> and numerous other platforms.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In the same spirit as contributing to FOSS, where no national regulations exist, NMHSs can still develop institution-level policies or guidelines in support of making FOSS available to the public.  The following are (some) key aspects to consider:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Establish an "architecture of participation":</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Who will be responsible for development, release management, and accepting external contributions?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How will commit access be governed and managed?  Does the project need a project steering committee or group of stakeholders to help drive the project?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How will external collaboration be addressed?  For example, will the project have a bug or issue tracker which can be used to identify new feature development, defects and/or bugs.  Will there be a dedicated discussion forum or mailing list for wider discussion?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Make clear how collaboration will work to the public (for example, by providing a <code>CONTRIBUTING.md</code> document for GitHub)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Make clear how security issues should be addressed (mitigation/release policies/timelines, contact points, etc.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What is the release schedule for new versions?</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>Choose a license that the software will be made available with (such as the Apache License, Version 2.0, MIT, etc.).  It is strongly advised to consider and consult organization policies to ensure proper licensing and understanding risk, responsibility and liability</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Choose the mechanism by which the software will be made available (GitHub, GtiLab, Codeberg, organizational website, etc.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ensure that a <code>README</code> is available with the code stating a clear mission and purpose</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Identify any supported WMO Technical Regulations</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ensure that the project has proper documentation for users (downloading, installing, configuring, running), as well as additinal documentation for developer or othe audience types (administrators, etc.)</p>

<li>
<p>Ensure the code is versioned (for example using Git as a version control system)</p>

<h4 id="_core_benefits_of_open_source_software"><a class="anchor" href="#_core_benefits_of_open_source_software"></a>Core Benefits of Open Source Software</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The core benefits of open source software can be summarized on three dimensions: autonomy and control, cost optimization,
and ecosystem flexibility—offering both practical advantages and adaptability. Details are as follows:</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p><strong>Exceptional autonomy and control</strong>: The code is open and licenses are flexible, allowing meteorological organizations
to perform deep customization as needed, directly modifying the code to add or remove functional modules to suit unique
operational scenarios (e.g., regional weather forecasting adjustments). This level of access also allows them to
independently identify and fix vulnerabilities, optimize performance for massive meteorological data processing, and
control the technical roadmap of core systems. Certain permissive licenses (e.g., MIT License, Apache License 2.0) even
permit using modified code as closed source in commercial products, balancing customization needs with operational requirements.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Significant cost advantages</strong>: No software license fees or subscription fees are required, suitable for national meteorological
services as well as deployments in regional forecasting centers. The availability of source code and community documentation
reduces trial-and-error costs during secondary development, making necessary human resource investment more manageable.
Meteorological organizations can also choose free community support or affordable third-party services (specialized in
meteorological applications) instead of expensive vendor support packages.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Avoiding vendor lock-in risks</strong>: Free from proprietary interfaces and data format dependencies, enabling free choice of
deployment environments (e.g., private or public clouds). Even if the original project is discontinued, maintenance can
be taken over independently or by a third party. Moreover, multiple service providers are often support the same open
source software, strengthening the user’s bargaining power.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Excellent cross-platform portability</strong>: Most open source tools run on multiple operating systems (e.g., Windows and
Linux), eliminating the need for separate purchases. Adherence to common technical standards (e.g., WMO GRIB data formats)
lowers system integration difficulty. Modular design facilitates containerized deployment and cross-cluster migration,
adapting to architectural upgrades in meteorological data centers.</p>

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>FOSS can also play a significant role as an indicator of the feasibility of Technical Regulation
implementation.  As part of the standards development phase, developing the associated FOSS
implementation(s) aids in determining "fit for purpose" of the specification.  In addition, FOSS
implementation during standards development allows for an open review and assessment on how a
standard is implemented (supported network protocols, avaiability of tooling/libraries for
integration, as well as speed of implementation (if a FOSS implementation during the development
of a standard takes a considerable level of effort, why?  Is the complexity acceptable for the
scope of the standard?  Determining these aspects earlier can help improve and adjust the standard
while in development (as opposed to formal amendment processes once approved by WMO).  The agile and parallel
development of WIS2 standards and FOSS is a key example in this context (see <a href="#_case_study_wis2_foss_and_agile_development">Case study: WIS2, FOSS, and agile development</a>).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Another indicator is the number of implementations.  For example, the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC)
mandates that a proposed standard requires at least 3 implementations for consideration by its
Technical Committee.  This provides "proof" to the Technical Committee that the standard can be
implemented, and has investment from various projects as early adopters.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In summary, while FOSS is not in scope for being identified as part of a Technical Regulation, it
is a strong indicator of the the maturity, applicability and sustainability of a given standard.  Implementing
FOSS during standards development provides safety in investment, iterative improvements,
and confidence for widespread and sustainable adoption and implementation by Members.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>The WMO Information System 2.0 (WIS 2.0) is the framework for WMO data sharing in the 21st century for all WMO domains and disciplines. It supports the WMO Unified Data policy and the Global Basic Observing Network (GBON) and makes international, regional, and national data sharing simple, effective, and inexpensive. The idea that no Member should be left behind and the objective of lowering the barrier to adoption has been at the core of WIS 2.0 development. These objectives inspire the principles underpinning the WIS 2.0 technical framework, such as adopting open standards and Web technologies to facilitate sharing of increasing variety and volume of real-time data.<sup class="footnote">[<a id="_footnoteref_3" class="footnote" href="#_footnotedef_3" title="View footnote.">3</a>]</sup></p>

<p>The WMO Executive Council, through <a href="https://library.wmo.int/idviewer/66258/1147">Resolution 34 (EC-76)</a> - Implementation plan update of the WMO Information System 2.0, endorsed the WMO Information System 2.0 (WIS2) implementation plan. The Resolution also recognized the importance of establishing a pilot phase to develop the WIS2 infrastructure and begin testing it, in order to be ready for a pre-operational phase in 2024, and then for the transition starting in 2025.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The pilot phase was completed at the end of 2023, with several Members collaborating in building the WIS2 infrastructure. Each Member had a different role in the WIS2 framework and implemented a specific component. Starting in January 2024, the implementation of WIS2 entered the pre-operational phase in preparation for transitioning to WIS2.  On 01 January 2025, WIS2 became operational.<sup class="footnote">[<a id="_footnoteref_4" class="footnote" href="#_footnotedef_4" title="View footnote.">4</a>]</sup></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>WIS2 is comprised of a number of key standards, including (but are not limited to):</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Internet and messaging protocols for data and metadata transmission (HTTP, MQTT)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>metadata encodings for dataset descriptions (WMO Core Metadata Profile) and notifications (WIS2 Notification Message)</p>
</li>

<p>Driven by collaboration, the development and testing of FOSS significantly helped with early assessment of the WIS2 standards in development.  As a result, WIS2 standards were being tested in an agile environment and rapid feedback was provided that helped refine, adjust and improve the standards early and often.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>WIS2 FOSS implementations have resulted in a more stable and robust program delivery with significantly reduced risk to Members.  In addition, some tools have emerged as "Reference Implementations" as key resources for the precise implementation of various WIS2 standards which can either be deployed or studied by Members accordingly.  WIS2 Technical Regulations were approved with confidence as a result of the agile development of Open Standards and Open Source.</p>
